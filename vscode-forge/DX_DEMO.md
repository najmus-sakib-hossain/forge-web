# DX Metrics Demo

This file demonstrates the DX IntelliSense feature.

## Try It Out!

1. Type `dx` or `dx-` anywhere in this file
2. You'll see autocomplete suggestions for DX metrics
3. Hover over any metric reference below to see details

## Example Metrics

### Build Performance
Our build performance metric (dx-1) shows the current build time and optimization status.

### Code Quality  
The code maintainability score (dx-2) indicates how easy it is to maintain and extend the codebase.

### Testing
Test coverage analysis (dx-3) provides insights into how well our code is tested.

### Documentation
API documentation quality (dx-4) measures the completeness and clarity of our documentation.

### Architecture
Architecture complexity (dx-5) evaluates the overall system design and structure.

## Commands to Try

Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`) and try:

- **Forge: Show All DX Metrics** - See all available metrics
- **Forge: Start Watching** - Start monitoring file changes

## Example Code References

```javascript
// Reference DX metrics in your code
const performanceMetric = "dx-1";  // Hover over dx-1
const qualityMetric = "dx-2";      // Hover over dx-2
const testingMetric = "dx-3";      // Hover over dx-3

// Use in comments
// TODO: Improve dx-5 (complexity score needs optimization)
// NOTE: dx-8 shows excellent deployment reliability
```

```python
# Python example
build_perf = "dx-1"  # Build performance tracking
test_coverage = "dx-3"  # Test coverage metrics
```

```rust
// Rust example
// Current architecture complexity: dx-5
// Target: Improve to 85+ score
let metric = "dx-7"; // Code review efficiency
```

## Hover Instructions

**Hover over any dx-N reference** (like dx-1, dx-2, etc.) to see:
- Metric name and description
- Current score visualization
- Detailed breakdown of metrics
- Last updated timestamp

## Click for Details

When using autocomplete, **select a metric** to see a beautiful detailed view with:
- Large circular score indicator
- Color-coded performance levels
- Comprehensive metrics grid
- Category information
