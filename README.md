# DX Forge - Production VCS & Orchestration Engine

DX Forge is a powerful tool designed to streamline and enhance your development workflow by integrating version control systems (VCS) with orchestration capabilities. It allows developers to manage code repositories, automate deployment processes, and coordinate complex workflows with ease.

<!--
So, currently the forge is just showing an github like web: which is fine for now - but our main task in here rigth now to make forge rust crate where I can use this in our other dx tools like ui, icons, style to control their actions like when they will start and when they will stop and maintain a versioning like git and manage code generated by dx tools specially so please make sure that is correct by studying current codebase and making tasks todoes - check all brancing and oher features with file watching by files changes or editor LSP changes for that make sure that vscode-forge works and output current changes in the current code editor dir if the dx or forge extension is present or default back to file change detection @vscode-forge @src

Please do the next steps
